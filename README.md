# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains small Python projects that I built to practice my programming skills and showcase my learning journey toward becoming a Data Scientist. These projects cover basic concepts such as file handling, automation, and user interaction.

## 📌 Projects

### 1️) Task Manager
A simple task manager that allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
**Features:**
- Add and manage tasks easily.
- Store tasks in a structured format.
- View completed and pending tasks.
 

### 2️) Menu-Driven Calculator
A command-line calculator for performing basic mathematical operations.
**Features:**
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Simple menu-driven interface.
 

### 3️) File Organizer
A tool that organizes files in a directory based on file type.

**Features:**
- Automatically sorts files into categorized folders.
- Supports multiple file types.

 
 ### 4) Number Guessing Game
A game in which user have to guess the number from 1 to 100.
**Features:**
- Code display, how user answer is away or close to correct answer after each guessing.
- After final guessing of correct number,the number of attempt required is diplay.

   
### 5)AI Chatbot using OpenAI API
This is a chatbot built using Python and the OpenAI API, which allows users to have interactive conversations 
with an AI model. The chatbot takes user input, sends it to OpenAI’s API, and returns AI-generated responses.
**How It Works:**
Install the required package:
bash
Copy
Edit
>pip install openai
**Get the OpenAI API Key:**
Create an account on OpenAI and generate an API key.
Store the API key securely in your script or use environment variables.
**Implement the Chatbot**
Import the OpenAI module and configure the API key.
Take user input and send it to the OpenAI API using openai.ChatCompletion.create().
Retrieve the AI-generated response and display it in a conversational format.
**Handle Errors and Optimization**
Implement error handling for API request failures.
Use efficient models like "gpt-3.5-turbo" for faster responses.
Ensure proper input validation and user-friendly interactions.
**How to Build Your Own**
Install Python and the OpenAI library.
Get an API key from OpenAI and integrate it into your script.
Use openai.ChatCompletion.create() to interact with the AI model.
Run the script in a loop to allow continuous conversation.
For more details, refer to OpenAI API Documentation.
